# NLP-Projects
Welcome to our NLP Sentiment Analysis project! 
I have analyzed Amazon text reviews using NLTK for sentiment analysis, leveraging the VADER and RoBERTa models. 
Our toolkit includes Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data visualization, providing valuable insights into customer sentiments toward various products.
With the abundance of textual data available on Amazon, this project serves as a valuable tool for businesses and researchers seeking to gain actionable insights from customer feedback. Whether you're interested in exploring sentiment trends, conducting sentiment analysis experiments, or simply learning about NLP techniques, this repository has something for you.
